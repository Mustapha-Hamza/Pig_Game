# Pig Game 🎲🐷

Pig Game is a simple and fun dice game for two players! Test your luck and strategy as you roll the dice and compete to reach 100 points first.

## 🎮 How to Play
1. **Rolling the Dice**: 
   - Each player takes turns to roll the dice. The outcome of each roll is displayed on the respective player's dashboard.
2. **Current Points**:
